# Breath of the Wild Online Store

This is a simple front / backend applicaiton for tracking store inventories.

## Frontend Github Repo

## Requests

While the backend has the ability to handle more requests, for this applicaiton, I am using the following three:

Get:
    View all Stores, and their Stocks.
Patch:
    Update the quantity of a Stock (Buy / Sell).
Delete:
    Delete a Stock from a Store.
